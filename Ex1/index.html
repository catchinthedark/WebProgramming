          <p>Venice, Italian Venezia, city, major seaport, and capital of both the provincia (province) of Venezia and the regione (region) of Veneto, northern Italy. An island city, it was once the centre of a maritime republic. It was the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and the continent’s commercial and cultural link to Asia. Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically, and in its days as a republic the city was styled la serenissima (“the most serene” or “sublime”). It remains a major Italian port in the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres.</p>

      <h1>Geography and Culture</h2>
	  <h1>The Lanscape</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>Situated at the northwestern end of the Adriatic Sea, Venice lies on an archipelago in the crescent-shaped Laguna Veneta (Venice Lagoon), which stretches some 32 miles (51 km) from the reclaimed marshes of Jesolo in the north to the drained lands beyond Chioggia at the southern end. The shallow waters of the lagoon are protected by a line of sandbanks, or lidi, whose three gaps, or porti, allow passage of the 3-foot (1-metre) tides and the city’s maritime traffic. On the sandbanks are many small settlements, some of them centuries old. The best-known is the Lido itself, which has been a fashionable seaside resort since the 19th century.</p>

            <p>Settlement in the lagoon predates Roman times, but the present urban structure took shape in the early 7th century, when migrants from the mainland swelled existing fishing communities on the higher mudflats and sandbanks. Among these early settlements, Rivo Alto, its name corrupted over time to Rialto, was the most central and became the heart of Venice, linking together 118 separate islands with bridges and canals and subordinating all other settlements to the rule of its elected doge (duke). In all these lagoonal settlements the characteristic plan, still detectable in the street patterns, was dominated by a navigable channel from which side channels branched at intervals.</p>

      <h1>The Culture</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>Today Venice is recognized as part of the artistic and architectural patrimony of all humanity, a fitting role for a city whose thousand-year economic and political independence was sustained by its role in global trading. The situation of the city on islands has limited modern suburban spread beyond the historic centre; its framework of canals and narrow streets has prevented the intrusion of automobiles; and its unmatched wealth of fine buildings and monuments dating from the period of commercial dominance has ensured a keen and almost universal desire for sensitive conservation.</p>

            <p>What is there to say about Venice that hasn’t already been said? This most celebrated of cities has seen it all, inspiring artists and lovers alike for centuries. Italo Calvino wrote a gorgeous book about it, and everyone from Jan Morris to Thomas Mann has had a go at summing up the magic of this place.
                But still, there is something about the food here that hits a little different. Venetian recipes are the result of over a thousand years of influences from those native to the lagoon and the many folks that have passed through it, trading goods and ingredients with their stories and currency. The best restaurants in Venice might surprise you. Just when you think everything to say about Venice had already been said, your taste buds beg to differ.</p>
